----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------:

West of Loathing is a single-player slapstick comedy 
adventure role-playing game set in the wild west of the 
Kingdom of Loathing universe. Traverse snake-infested 
gulches, punch skeletons wearing cowboy hats, grapple 
with demon cows, and investigate a wide variety of 
disgusting spittoons.

Talk your way out of trouble as a silver-tongued Snake 
Oiler, plumb the refried mysteries of the cosmos as a 
wise and subtle Beanslinger, or let your fists do the 
talking as a fierce Cow Puncher. Explore a vast open 
world and encounter a colorful cast of characters, some
of whom are good, many of whom are bad, and a few of 
whom are ugly.

Features:

* A sprawling open world, chock full of danger, quests, 
puzzles, and mysteries

* Lush hand-drawn black and white graphics

* Thousands of jokes, gags, and goofs

* Crunchy turn-based combat (but only if you want it)

* Liberal use of the Oxford comma

* Over 50 hats

* Disreputable saloons

* Several gulches

* A drunk horse
